# ***Pyber Analysis with Matplotlib***

## Overview of Project:

### Overview:

In this project, we are asked to perform an exploratory analysis of the company Pyber, in order to find a relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders.This analysis is carried with the purpose of aiding the company to locate which types of cities they should be targeting to increase their profit.



### Purpose:

We are asked to perform an analysis of the company Pyber by creating a summary Data Frame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas, followed by plotting multiple line graphs that show the total weekly fares for each city type using Matplotlib.


## Results:

Our analysis found the following results:

- Urban cities contain the highest amount of total rides, total drivers and total fares, but the lowest amount on the averages.
- Rural cities contained the lowest amount of total rides, total drivers and total fares, but the highest amount on the averages

<sub> Data Frame Summary <sub>

- The trend for the Urban cities is that on average, the fare between the months of January and April was between the range of $1,500 to $2,500, with Urban cities obtaining the highest range.
- The trend for the Rural cities is that on average, the fare between the months of January and April was between the range of $0 to $5000, with Rural cities obtaining the lowest range
- The trend for the Suburban cities is that on average, the fare betweeen the months of January and April was between the range of $600 to $1,500.
- The months with the highests fare for each type of city were the following:
  - Urban: February/ March
  - Suburban: February
  - Rural: April

## Summary:

Overall, the company Pyber is highly successful in Urban cities because the fares on average are lower. To increase the success of the company in Rural cities, it would be ideal to increase the amount of drives as well as lower the fares when possible to increase the amount of people of these populations that use these services.

The company could increase its profits if overall the averages of Rural and Suburban cities were closer to the averages of Urban cities, or at the least the Rural and Suburban cities were following eachother closely within the numbers.

Furthermore, it appears to be a trend that between the months of February and April, all cities seem to increase its total fare amount so it would be wise to do additional research and analysis to figure out what factors contributed to the increase of sales, and if these factors can be applied throughout the year to increase sales overall.
